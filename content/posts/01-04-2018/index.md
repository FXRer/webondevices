**Getting started with electronics and hardware prototyping for JavaScript web developers has never been easier with Node.js.**

![electronics](http://www.webondevices.com/posts/IMG_20150330_195450.jpg)

In the browser hardware resources and access to the USB port is **restricted** as the code running on any random website could not be trusted.

The situation is different when you **run your JavaScript code on your computer**. Since now you are outside the limitations of the browser, you have a lot more tools to work with!

Node.js is a JavaScript engine running outside the browser that enables us to write applications interacting with **custom electronics** you built or hardware resources of your computer.

With this knowledge it's possible to build **simple robots** or **home automation** system with JavaScript only, a language that web developers are already familiar with.

There is a [free PDF ebook to download](#subscription) to help you get started. In less than a couple of hours you will be able to build **simple circuits with LED lights, temperature and light sensors**.

Once you are familiar with the basics you can dive into the [JavaScript Electronics book](#subscription) that covers everything in a lot more detail (but still from the very basics and not assuming any prior knowledge in electronics).

Projects in the book include a **Motion Sensing Alarm System** and a **Smart Talking Plant**.
